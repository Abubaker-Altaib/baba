  I create a purchase order.
-
  !record {model: purchase.order, id: purchase_order4}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_3
    invoice_method: picking
    order_line:
      - product_id: product.product_product_pc3
        price_unit: 900
        
-
 I confirm apurchase order where invoice control is 'Based on receptions'.
-
  !workflow {model: purchase.order, action: purchase_confirm, ref: purchase.order_purchase2}
  
  
-
  I check that no invoice for order.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    purchase_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order4"))
    assert len(purchase_order.invoice_ids) == 0, "Invoice should not be generated on order confirmation."


-
  Now I create an invoice for order on reception.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    pick_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('purchase_id','=',ref('purchase_order4'))])
    self.action_invoice_create(cr, uid, pick_ids, ref('account.expenses_journal'))


-
 I check that the invoice of order.
-
 !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    purchase_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order4"))
    assert len(purchase_order.invoice_ids) == 1, "Invoice should be generated."

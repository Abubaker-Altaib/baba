  I confirm the RFQ.
-
  !workflow {model: purchase.order, action: purchase_confirm, ref: order_purchase_test}
-
  I check that Reception details after confirmed RFQ.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    purchase_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("order_purchase_test"))
    for picking in purchase_order.picking_ids:
      assert picking.type == "quality", "Reception type should be quality"
